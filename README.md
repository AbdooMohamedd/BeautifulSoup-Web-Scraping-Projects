## Introduction

Web scraping is a technique used to extract information from websites. This repository showcases multiple projects where BeautifulSoup, requests, and CSV modules are used to perform web scraping tasks in a responsible manner. The goal is to collect data, process it, and store it in CSV files for further analysis.

## Features

- Extract data from multiple websites.
- Use BeautifulSoup for parsing HTML and XML documents.
- Utilize requests for making HTTP requests to fetch web pages.
- Save scraped data into CSV files for easy analysis and storage.
- Ensure responsible and ethical web scraping practices.

## Installation

To get started with these projects, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbdooMohamedd/BeautifulSoup-Web-Scraping-Projects.git
cd BeautifulSoup-Web-Scraping-Projects
pip install beautifulsoup4 csv requests 
```

## Usage

Each project is contained in its own directory. You can navigate to a specific project and run the scraping script as follows:

```bash
cd project-directory
python scrape.py
```

Replace `project-directory` with the actual directory name of the project you want to run.
